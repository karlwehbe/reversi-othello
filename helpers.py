"""
Helpers.py is a collection of functions that primarily make up the Reversi/Othello game logic.
Beyond a few things in the World init, which can be copy/pasted this should be almost
all of what you'll need to simulate games in your search method.

Functions:
    get_directions    - a simple helper to deal with the geometry of Reversi moves
    count_capture     - how many flips does this move make. Game logic defines valid moves as those with >0 returns from this function. 
    count_capture_dir - a helper for the above, unlikely to be used externally
    execute_move      - update the chess_board by simulating a move
    flip_disks        - a helper for the above, unlikely to be used externally
    check_endgame     - check for termination, who's won but also helpful to score non-terminated games
    get_valid_moves   - use this to get the children in your tree
    random_move       - basis of the random agent and can be used to simulate play

    For all, the chess_board is an np array of integers, size nxn and integer values indicating square occupancies.
    The current player is (1: Blue, 2: Brown), 0's in the board mean empty squares.
    Move pos is a tuple holding [row,col], zero indexed such that valid entries are [0,board_size-1]
